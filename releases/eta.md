# When will version X be released?

**When it's ready.**

# When will feature X be released?

**I don't know.**

# Do you have an ETA?

**No.**

# Not even a vague ETA?

**No.**

# Why can't you give an ETA?

Because this is an open source, personal project. I work on it when I have time. This isn't a business with project managers planning for months at a time with dedicated resources.

I know this is frustrating but that's how it is.

Your requested feature will be worked on and released at some point and **it's gonna be great**. That's all I can promise you.
